			<h1>Smart Tendering: The Future of Procurement</h1>
			<p class="par">
				<br />
				Our platform and support services continue to work seven days a week. We
				encourage customers and suppliers tom continue publishing and
				participating in procurement to support the economy. There’s a growing
				idea in logistics that smart tendering is the future of procurement. But
				what is smart tendering? First of all, tendering is the competitive
				practice of submitting and receiving formal bids to perform a job or
				service. In terms of transportation, tendering is the process of
				negotiating and aligning shipments of freight most optimally between
				shippers and carriers, or third-party logistics providers. Smart
				tendering is the same process, but aided by software that uses AI and
				machine learning to automate certain aspects of tendering. The goal of
				tendering is to strategically and efficiently match a freight shipment
				with the most ideal and cost-effective carrier. Smart tendering uses
				digital tools that make accomplishing that goal easier. We’ll dive
				deeper into smart tendering and the future of procurement in this post.
				But while we’re at it, we should also perform a public service and draw
				a clear distinction between two hot, similar-sounding topics of 2021:
				smart tenders and chicken tendies. So let’s dive in and find out what,
				if anything, smart tendering has to do with the seemingly global
				obsession with fried chicken tenders! Grab your sauce, buy the dip,
				we’re taking a dunk!
